            Namaste, You are warmly welcome to my site.
Personal websites are becoming increasingly popular. 
They can be used effectively for promotion, job searches,
personal branding, and just for communicating with friends and 
family. These personal websites can often serve as a creative outlet 
and allow the site owner more freedom than they would have with a 
website that is tied to their business. Personal websites also allow 
the owner to change directions easily if their interests or purpose 
for the site changes at some point in the future.

       <p>My name is Hari Regmi. I am not a professional webdesigner, but have tried to design it for fun. I designed this site in around 2012 to document my articles and left those creativeness 
        efforts aside due to various reasons in the past. Now, it's 
        time to restart my way of joying and would like to hear from you in 
        making my site robust, creative, useful and of your interest. Your 
        feedback is a lot to me for my future journey. Please feel free to
        join hands in my efforts to inbox me your opinions/comments/suggestions/feedbacks.</p>
